  DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO PROJECT 

2.Problem statement and requirements:-
  The project involves creating a detailed monthly sales performance analysis dashboard. The core objectives are to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total orders, and total quantity sold, along with their month-over-month (MoM) trends and differences. Additionally, various interactive and insightful visualizations are required to interpret sales behavior across different dimensions, including calendar-based trends, weekday vs. weekend performance, store locations, product categories, top-selling products, and time-of-day patterns.

KPI Requirements:
-Total Sales: Monthly total sales with MoM change and difference from the previous month.
-Total Orders: Monthly order count with MoM change and difference from the previous month.
-Total Quantity Sold: Monthly quantities sold with MoM change and difference from the previous month.

Chart Requirements:
-Calendar Heat Map: Dynamic daily sales visualization with tooltips (sales, orders, quantity).
-Weekday vs. Weekend Analysis: Compare sales performance across weekdays and weekends.
-Store-wise Sales: MoM sales trends by location, highlighting increases/decreases.
-Daily Sales with Average Line: Line chart for daily sales showing average benchmarks.
-Product Category Analysis: Visualize sales distribution across product categories.
-Top 10 Products: Identify and display top-selling products by volume.
-Day-Hour Heat Map: Time-based heat map of sales, orders, and quantities.

3.Technologies:-
  -BI & Dashboarding Tool:
Power BI : Ideal for building interactive dashboards, slicers, dynamic visuals (calendar heat maps, line charts, bar charts), and DAX-based KPI calculations.
  
  -Data Modeling & Transformation:
Power Query (in Power BI): For data cleaning, shaping, and loading.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns, measures (e.g., MoM change, average daily sales), and dynamic tooltips.

  -Data Storage:
Microsoft Excel or CSV: For small to medium datasets.

  -Time Intelligence & Custom Calendar:
Custom Date Table in Power BI: Enables time-based calculations like YTD, MoM, and weekday/weekend segregation.
